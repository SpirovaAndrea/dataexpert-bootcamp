1. Types of Impact for Data Engineers

Data engineers can influence their organizations in multiple ways — from measurable improvements to cultural shifts within teams.

Types of Impact:

Measurable impact:

Increasing pipeline efficiency

Improving experimentation outcomes

Hard-to-measure impact:

Enhancing data quality

Enabling other teams to be more productive

Immeasurable impact:

Changing leadership intuitions and decision-making approaches

Strengthening team culture and collaboration

Being a “glue person” who connects technical and non-technical teams

2. Translating Your Role into Value

The true value of a data engineer extends beyond writing pipelines.

Key ways data engineers create value:

Supplying actionable insights through reliable data

Preventing bugs and maintaining trust in datasets

Increasing pipeline efficiency and reducing costs

Enabling other engineers to work faster through reusable infrastructure

Persuading decision-makers to rely on data instead of intuition

3. When Is an Insight Valuable?

An insight gains value when it changes or confirms how people think or act.

Insights are valuable when they:

Reinforce existing intuitions

Contradict existing intuitions

Fail to support or contradict intuitions (revealing uncertainty or data gaps)

4. Maintaining Trust in Data

Building trust in data is essential for adoption and decision-making.

Ways to maintain trust:

Implement quality checks throughout the pipeline

Create clear documentation for datasets and models

Set expectations using SLAs (Service Level Agreements)

Document known gaps or limitations transparently

5. Increasing Pipeline Efficiency

Efficiency in data pipelines allows faster delivery and easier maintenance.

Ways to increase efficiency:

Apply proper data modeling techniques

Improve on-call and incident response processes

Reduce data volumes where possible

Choose the right tools for the job

Simplify overly complex models — follow the 80/20 rule (focus on what provides the most value with minimal complexity)
