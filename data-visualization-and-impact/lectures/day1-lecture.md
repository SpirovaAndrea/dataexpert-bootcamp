# Data Visualization and Impact: Mastering Data Engineering — Day 1 Lecture

## 1. Types of Impact as a Data Engineer

### **Measurable Impact**
- Pipeline efficiency improvements  
- Experimentation outcomes  

### **Hard-to-Measure Impact**
- Data quality improvements  
- Team enablement and collaboration outcomes  

### **Immeasurable Impact**
- Shifting leadership intuition (influencing decisions through insights)  
- Team culture improvements (being a “glue” person who connects and supports others)

## 2. Translating Data Engineering Work into Value

Data engineers create impact through multiple channels:

- **Supplying insights** to stakeholders  
- **Preventing bugs** and maintaining data trust  
- **Increasing pipeline efficiency** through optimization  
- **Enabling other engineers** to work faster with better infrastructure  
- **Persuading decision-makers** to rely on data rather than intuition

## 3. When Is an Insight Valuable?

Insights are valuable when they achieve one of the following:
1. **Reinforce intuitions** (confirm existing beliefs)
2. **Contradict intuitions** (challenge assumptions)
3. **Fail to support or contradict intuitions** (highlight data limitations)

## 4. Maintaining Trust in Data

To ensure confidence in data products:
- Implement **quality checks**
- Maintain **clear documentation**
- Define **expectations and SLAs**
- Be transparent about **known data gaps**

---

## 5. Increasing Pipeline Efficiency

Ways to improve performance and reduce overhead:
- Apply **proper data modeling**
- Optimize **on-call processes**
- Reduce **data volume** where possible
- Choose **the right tool for the job**
- Simplify models using the **80/20 rule** — focus on essential 80% of impact with 20% of effort
