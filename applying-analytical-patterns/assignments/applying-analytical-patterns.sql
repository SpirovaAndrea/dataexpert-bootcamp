-- Week 4 Applying Analytical Patterns
-- 1. A query that does state change tracking for players
-- Goal: Track how each player's active status changes
--       between NBA seasons using window functions.
WITH player_state_changes AS (
    SELECT 
        player_name,
        current_season,
        is_active,
        -- LAG allows comparing a player's current and previous season statuses
        LAG(is_active) OVER (PARTITION BY player_name ORDER BY current_season) as previous_active_status
    FROM players_scd
    WHERE current_season IS NOT NULL
),

    SELECT 
        player_name,
        current_season,
        is_active,
        previous_active_status,
        -- Define transitions between active/inactive states

-- 2. A query that uses GROUPING SETS to do efficient aggregations of game_details data
-- Goal: Aggregate game_details data at multiple levels
--       (player-team, player-season, team) in one query.

-- Summary
-- This assignment demonstrates advanced analytical SQL patterns:

-- 1. STATE CHANGE TRACKING (Task 1)
--    - Uses LAG() window function to compare player activity across seasons
--    - Categorizes players as New, Retired, Continued, Returned, or Stayed Retired
--    - Enables historical lifecycle analysis of players

-- 2. GROUPING SETS (Task 2)
--    - Performs multiple aggregation levels (player-team, player-season, team) efficiently
--    - Uses GROUPING() to dynamically label aggregation levels
--    - Answers key analytical questions: top scorers by team or season, top-performing teams

-- 3. WINDOW FUNCTIONS ANALYSIS (Task 3)
--    - Applies ROW_NUMBER() and SUM() OVER windows for rolling and streak calculations
--    - Detects best 90-game team performance periods
--    - Identifies LeBron Jamesâ€™ longest streak scoring over 10 points

-- WHY THESE PATTERNS MATTER:
-- - Enable time-based and hierarchical insights without repetitive queries
-- - Optimize query performance via window functions and grouping sets
-- - Provide reusable frameworks for sports analytics, finance, or user behavior tracking
